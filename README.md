Basic Facebook Messenger bot that fetches weather given a location. Built to test out Messenger's bot platform and learn its capabilities. Bots are the future??? (in some cases) Implementing some wit.ai to make this slightly more intuitive, but for now, typing "weather" into Google is still faster.
